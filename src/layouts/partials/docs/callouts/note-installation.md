**Please note:** this step is absolutely optional. It aims for advanced user who want to speed up development process with professional grade Front-End toolset shiped with GoHugo. If you are not familiar with these tools and have no time to dive in you can still use plain HTML / CSS / JS to customize GoHugo. Files you need are located inside **glowing/dist** folder. In this case you can skip this and next sections. Happy coding :)
